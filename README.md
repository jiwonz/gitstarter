This simple program is a useful and straightforward CLI program for when you forget to start and initialize git.
## Usage
```sh
gitstarter --- show usage
gitstarter init <directory:optional> --- start the git init prompt
```
## Memo
- Only linux arm64 build release support yet.
- If you want to use the program for your operating system, download Go and build it. I will later create my own gocompiler program and release it for other OS.

## Installation
Just [download the release file](https://github.com/jiwonz/gitstarter/releases) for your OS environment, and I recommend putting it in a bin folder in your PATH
